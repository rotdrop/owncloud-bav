"Data entered will not be stored. BAV is able to compute the BIC given the "
"bank-id, and to compute the IBAN given additionally the bank-account id. "
"Additionally, it verifies that the bank-id exists by comparing with the data "
"provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. It will also pick the correct check-sum "
"formula for the given bank-account id (there are a few hundret possible "
"check-sum formulas, differing from bank to bank). Finally, given an IBAN, it "
"will extract the bank-id and bank-account-id and also perform the check-sum "
"computations in order to test whether the provided bank-account data is "
"consistent. Please keep in mind that check-sums cannot catch all possible "
"errors."
